hello, my real name is omar.

i am interested to learn programming, i always loved math, i found it lovely doing problem solving with that in real life equations.

my skills in real life are basically being a jack of all trades, master of none.
i have many skills, i do a lot of stuff but i don't really go to master them for the rest of my life, i just know the majority of what it is and can do a fine job
with just couple of days to retrieve my skills again.

i always thought i had a weak memory, apparently not, i have a very strong one, i still remember things when i was 3 and 2 years old, and i remember them clearly.
i do video editing, audio editing, level designing in unreal engine 4, i am a certified designer in autodesk and i had my fun with either 3d projects or VFX.

today 22/08/2021 i quit any other job i had before and decided to kick it straight into programming in my 29th of age.

that's all.. ty.
